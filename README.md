### Project title

Spotify Helper

### What and why?

A software built to enhance the users' experience when using Spotify. When listening to music, spotify's own lyric function doesn't always work, especially on songs that are not in english, so develop a software that fix this would be meaningful to the listeners.

### For whom?

Music listeners using Spotify.

### How?

It will automatically detect the song being played at the moment, find the lyric of that song, and go to the correct location in the lyrics, this can be made to appear as a floating window. This step includes finding the source that has the correct lyrics for the specific song, and matching lyrics to the current location.

It will also have a option to display the current note (pitch), the apperances of each note in the song to let the listener determine if this is a song suitable for them.

### Scope

Support for different language would be a challenge, and for songs that were changed in live, synchronizing the timestamp may require scraping from video website like Youtube. Finding the pitch and make a general report for each song would also take some work. New features can be added if finished early.
